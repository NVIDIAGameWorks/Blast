/**
Describes the connectivity between support chunks via bonds.

Vertices in the support graph are termed "nodes," and represent particular chunks (NvBlastChunk) in an NvBlastAsset.
The indexing for nodes is not the same as that for chunks.  Only some chunks are represented by nodes in the graph,
and these chunks are called "support chunks."

Adjacent node indices and adjacent bond indices are stored for each node, and therefore each bond is represented twice in this graph,
going from node[i] -> node[j] and from node[j] -> node[i].  Therefore the size of the getAdjacentNodeIndices() and getAdjacentBondIndices()
arrays are twice the number of bonds stored in the corresponding NvBlastAsset.

The graph is used as follows.  Given a SupportGraph "graph" and node index i, (0 <= i < graph.nodeCount), one may find all
adjacent bonds and nodes using:

	const uint32_t* adjacencyPartition = graph.getAdjacencyPartition();
	const uint32_t* adjacentNodeIndices = graph.getAdjacentNodeIndices();
	const uint32_t* adjacentBondIndices = graph.getAdjacentBondIndices();

	// adj is the lookup value in adjacentNodeIndices and graph.getAdjacentBondIndices()
	for (uint32_t adj = adjacencyPartition[i]; adj < adjacencyPartition[i+1]; ++adj)
	{
		// An adjacent node:
		uint32_t adjacentNodeIndex = adjacentNodeIndices[adj];

		// The corresponding bond (that connects node index i with node indexed adjacentNodeIndex:
		uint32_t adjacentBondIndex = adjacentBondIndices[adj];
	}

For a graph node with index i, the corresponding asset chunk index is found using graph.getChunkIndices()[i].  The reverse mapping
(obtaining a graph node index from an asset chunk index) can be done using the

	NvBlastAssetGetChunkToGraphNodeMap(asset, logFn);

function.  See the documentation for its use.  The returned "node index" for a non-support chunk is the invalid value 0xFFFFFFFF.
